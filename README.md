## ❓ Questions / Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
This project is driven by key business questions and performance metrics aimed at understanding sales trends and customer behavior:

1 Sales Performance

~ What is the total revenue generated over time?

~ Which months or quarters show the highest and lowest sales?

2 Top Products & Categories

~ Which products and product categories are generating the most revenue?

~ What are the best-selling items in terms of quantity?

3 Customer Behavior

~ Which customers are contributing the most to total sales?

~ How frequently do repeat customers make purchases?

4 Geographical Insights

~ Which cities or regions contribute the most to overall sales?

~ Are there specific locations with consistently high or low performance?

5 Order Trends

~ What is the average order value?

~ How many orders are placed per day, week, or month?

6 Profitability Analysis

~ What is the profit margin across different product categories?

~ Are there products with high sales but low profitability?

7 Shipping and Delivery Metrics

~ What is the average delivery time?

~ Are there delays or patterns in delivery times across regions?


## 🔍 Project Process
This project followed a step-by-step data analysis workflow to explore and interpret key aspects of e-commerce performance:

1 Data Collection & Import

~ Loaded e-commerce sales data into a Python environment using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for analysis.

2 Data Cleaning & Preparation

~ Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized column formats, and parsed dates for time-series analysis.

~ Created new derived columns (e.g., profit, order month, customer segmentation) for deeper insights.

3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

~ Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

~ Visualized key trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify relationships and outliers.

4 KPI Evaluation

~ Defined and analyzed core KPIs such as revenue, order count, average order value, top products, and customer lifetime value.

5 Insight Generation

~ Interpreted trends across different dimensions like time, geography, and product categories to support business decisions.

6 Visualization & Reporting

~ Created clear and insightful plots and dashboards to communicate findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders.

## 📈 Project Insights
~ Sales performance varied significantly across months, revealing clear seasonal trends and promotional impacts.

~ A small percentage of products and customers accounted for a large portion of total revenue, highlighting the potential for targeted marketing strategies.

~ Certain regions consistently outperformed others, suggesting strong local demand that could be leveraged for regional campaigns.

~ High-profit products were not always the best-sellers, indicating opportunities to align pricing and promotion strategies for better profitability.

~ Delivery delays in specific regions or order types pointed to potential areas for logistics and supply chain optimization.



## ✅ Final Conclusion
This project provided a data-driven overview of e-commerce sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
